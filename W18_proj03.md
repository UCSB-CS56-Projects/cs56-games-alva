The following issues still need to be done:

#3: Refactor the physics engine (500)
#10: Create a level editor gui (500)
#22: Move to graphics library (400)
#23: Add code coverage (100)
#24: Add unit testing (200)
#27: Create instructions screen (100)
#31: Fix freeze bug with jumping (150)
#32: Add harmful obstacles (200)

In total, this adds to 1950 points, though nearly half of that is in two tasks that seem fairly difficult. Lower-effort stuff (#23 and above) add up to 750.
