(a) A robot navigates through an obstacle course trying to reach the end.

(b) As the robot you can move boxes, flip switches, and jump. No objective yet.

(c) The software run but an end goal has yet to be established. Certain features of the game have not been fully optimized.

(d) The robot could be able to shoot rockets and destroy obstacles, peform a double jump, and be able to acquire powerups.There could also be more obstacles such as water tiles or maps with a limitted amount of time to complete.

(e) The README.md file is already good. There are animations and instructions that inform new users on how to play the game. There could be more informaton on the keys used to perform some actions.

(f) The build.xml file is adequate. It is based on Ant, and could be translated into Maven or Graddle.

(g)There are a sufficient amount of issues to achieve over a 1000 points. For the most part the issues are clear.

(h)Some of the issues we encountered were that the robot is able to jump of the map easily. Also the boxes can be dragged and moved without the robot being close to them.

(i)The code is separated into multiple classes that work individually from each other. It is very readable and clean. There are comments that clarify the purpose of certain lines of code and the Javadoc provides a detailed explanation of how all the methods work. If I were to pass this project I would describe it as a well polished and highly documented.

(j)As far as I can see there are no JUnit tests. To increase coverage we can add tests for some of the existing classes and new ones we implement.
