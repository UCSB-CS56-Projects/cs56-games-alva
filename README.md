# cs56-games-alva

This games objective is to create a fun and interesting platformer where you move boxes, flip switches, and avoid obstacles.


* [javadoc on a-saied's site](http://a-saied.github.io/cs56-games-alva/javadoc/index.html)

* [javadoc on ucsb-cs56-projects](http://ucsb-cs56-projects.github.io/cs56-games-alva/javadoc/index.html)

## Features to add:
* Adding obstacles to test players reaction time and ability
* Create a background.
* Make new maps
* Add level editor GUI
* Add animations for different things the robot can do (pushing boxes, flipping switches)

## Things to refactor:
* The physics engine. It currently is slow and doesn't work that well. Look into AABX collision or another method that is more efficient.
* Animation on non-Linux machines. This game uses Linux graphics and runs unbearably slow on Windows and Mac. Find a way to run animation on these machines at the same rate as on Linux. 

## How to Run
To start the game, put "./gradlew run" into the command line (no quotations).
(Alternitively, put "ant run")

### Hit Space bar to use Flip Switches

### Hold F to grab and move Boxes

## How to Play
Objective: Get Alva from one end of the level to the other 
To play, simply use A and D to move left and right. W is to jump. SPACE is used to flip switches when nearby. Hold F to grab boxes and move them.

## F17 Final Remarks
* The code is very well factored out already. Try to stay with this standard when fixing any of the issues. Instead of adding to an existing class, try adding your own classes to handle new issues. 
* Make sure that you follow conventions already determined. Animations should be loaded in Animation.java, edits to building the world should be handled in World.java, etc. 
* Read all of the code before beginning. Make sure you understand what every file does before you change anything. Chances are it will make your issue fixes simpler if you understand how everything comes together. 

## W18 Final Remarks
* Like the previous quarter said, this code is factored really well and is fairly easy to understand. Take some time to go through the code and get an understanding of how everything works, it shouldn't take too long. Take a look at GameDriver, MainComp, and the stuff in the Util folder; that should help you understand how the game runs.
* Any future "screens" that are implemented (instructions screen, game over screen, etc) should be created using the interface and current examples found in the screens folder.
* Once again, as previous remarks have suggested, follow the conventions already in place, such as Animation and Assets handling.
* Think of more features to be added. There are plenty of unused assets in the assets folder, so go take a look in there. The game is more or less a blank slate, so add what you think could improve the gameplay.
* Finally, there are currently two build flows implemented, Gradle and Ant. Although Ant is still included, it is only for backwards compatability, and any future developments in that area should be accomplished using the Gradle build flow implemented using the gradle wrapper and build.gradle file.
